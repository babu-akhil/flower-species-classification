Classification of flower species:
4 predictor variables - petal and sepal length and width

I used 10-fold Stratified Cross Verification.
I created models using 6 algorithms - Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, 
K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayesian, and Support Vector Machine

Upon comparitng these 6 algorithms for accuracy scores,
SVM were found to have the highest accuracy on the testing dataset.
